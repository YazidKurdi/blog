      <description>This post is going to be an extended version of &amp;ldquo;About me&amp;rdquo;, how I think, solve issues and how I learned R language on my own. Having finished my Bacholers degree in Industrial Engineering and putting a stop to my E-sports career I decided to re-ignite my interest in data science from my previous work. I had zero experience in coding and moderate statistical knowledge.
Since I have stopped working I built an 8 hour schedule per day rule of studying R and I stuck to it, I tried to learn everything, even if I did not fully absorb the material I would power through, it will be frustrating but it will be worth it when the &amp;ldquo;light bulb&amp;rdquo; in your head switches on and you start understanding the topic better.</description>

      <description>I am an Industrial engineer, graduated in 07/2017 from the German Jordanian University including a one year work program in Germany, which was mainly focused on Data analysis.
Having a hobby in E-sports allowed me to professionally follow this career path for one and a half years after graduating. Travelling to Malaysia, China, Dubai, Lebanon and Abu Dahbi to compete.Unfortunatly, due to the E-sports growth and development in the Middle east, continuing this path was filled with uncertainty.</description>
