I am an Industrial engineer, graduated in 07/2017 from the German Jordanian University including a one year work program in Germany, which was mainly focused on Data analysis.

Having a hobby in E-sports allowed me to professionally follow this career path for one and a half years after graduating. Travelling to Malaysia, China, Dubai, Lebanon and Abu Dahbi to compete.Unfortunatly, due to the E-sports growth and development in the Middle east, continuing this path was filled with uncertainty.

Deciding to stop to follow up on my interest in Data analysis which was sparked in my working days in Germany. I began to study R language rigorously learning different disciplines and mainly focusing on Machine learning!
